# Stock-Price-Analysis
Analyze and gain insights from the historical stock data of various banks.

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to analyze and explore stock price data, providing insights and visualization. (This is not Financial Advice).

# Implementation
The project is implemented in a Python Jupyter Notebook. The code performs the following major steps:
1. Importing necessary libraries: Libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly, cufflinks, pandas_datareader, and yfinance are imported to support data analysis and visualization.
2. Data retrieval: Stock price data for selected banks is obtained using the pandas_datareader and yfinance libraries. The data span a specific time period, typically from a start date to an end date.
3. Data exploration and visualization: The imported data is explored and visualized using various techniques, including pair plots, dist plots, moving averages, and heat maps. This allows for a better understanding of the stock price trends, patterns, and correlations between different banks.
4. Descriptive statistics: Statistical measures such as minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation are calculated for the stock prices. This provides insights into the overall behavior and volatility of the stock market.
5. Data analysis: The data is analyzed to answer specific questions, such as identifying the maximum close price for each bank's stock throughout the given time period or determining the bank with the highest and lowest single-day returns. This analysis helps gain valuable insights into the performance and risk associated with different bank stocks.

## Usage 
To reproduce the project, follow these steps:
1. Set up a Python environment with the necessary libraries installed, including pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly, cufflinks, pandas_datareader, and yfinance.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file in your preferred environment.
3. Run each code cell sequentially to import the required libraries and datasets, visualize the data, and perform analysis.
4. Modify or customize the code as needed to fit your specific requirements.
5. Experiment with different visualizations, metrics, or models to gain further insights into stock prices.

## Conclusion
The stock price analysis project highlights the potential for gaining insights into bank stocks through data analysis and visualization. Further improvements can enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of predictions, contributing to informed investment decisions and a deeper understanding of the stock market dynamics.
